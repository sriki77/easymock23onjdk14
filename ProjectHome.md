The project is about porting the _[EasyMock 2.3](http://easymock.org/EasyMock2_3_Documentation.html)_ onto J2SE 1.4.

_EasyMock 2.3_ works only on Java 5 and above. This project removes all the Java 5 features from the code and the entire code is compiled using J2SE 1.4.

This port makes the features of _EasyMock 2.3_ available for use in projects running on J2SE 1.4.
